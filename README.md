# Polarsteps Data Parser

Python tool which designed to parse and extract data from the travel tracking app [Polarsteps](https://www.polarsteps.com/) data export. This tool serves two primary purposes:

1. **Data backup**: The data export does not support viewing your data in any useful way. To preserve the data (who knows where Polarsteps will be in 10 years), the tool combines the data and generates a PDF document.
2. **Data analysis & visualization**: The parsed data can also be leveraged for in-depth analysis, enabling users to gain insights into their travel patterns, destinations visited, duration of stays, distances traveled, and more. This opens up possibilities for statistical analysis, trend identification, and visualization of travel habits over time.
